I am a political consultant and researcher, currently working as policy officer for the [Ministry of Economic Affairs, Industry, Climate Action and Energy of North Rhine-Westphalia](https://www.wirtschaft.nrw/en) at the [Representation of the state to the German federation](https://www.mbei.nrw/de/ansprechpartner-bundes-und-europapolitik). Over the past years I dealt with political analysis, communication, and strategy from different perspectives.

Formerly, I worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the [Otto-Suhr-Institut für Politikwissenschaft](https://www.polsoz.fu-berlin.de/polwiss/index.html) which is part of the [Freie Universität Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/). In my dissertation, which I defended in February 2022, I did have a closer look at the digital social contexts in modern election campaigns. Generally, my research focuses on political communication, attitudes and behaviour - specifically in and around election campaigns. I published other research in the field and won the inaugural [Rudolf-Wildenmann prize for election research](https://www.forschungsgruppe.de/Aktuelles/Wildenmann_-_Preis_2024/) (awarded by Forschungsgruppe Wahlen) in 2024.

I taught undergrad courses at Freie Universität Berlin, namely "Introduction in Political Communication" and "Election Campaign Research" and previously taught introductory courses on statistics at the [Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz](https://www.uni-mainz.de/). Transferring insights from science to non-academic contexts is important to me. As an expert in political communication and campaign research I provide advice to political actors and participated in topical workshop with think tanks.

Before starting my PhD, I was working as a spokesperson for the [parliamentary group of the Green party in Baden-Württemberg](https://www.gruene-landtag-bw.de/) and as a member of the campaign staff at  the [Green party in Baden-Württemberg](https://www.gruene-bw.de/). I studied political science in a joint M.A. programme at [Universität Konstanz](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/), Germany and [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.cat/), Barcelona, Spain. Previously, I earned a B.Sc. in Communication Science at [Universität Hohenheim](https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/).
