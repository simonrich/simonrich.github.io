I am a political scientist and PhD candidate in the [Otto-Suhr-Institut für Politikwissenschaft](https://www.polsoz.fu-berlin.de/polwiss/index.html) at [Freie Universität Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/). I handed in my dissertation on the digital social contexts in modern election campaigns in summer 2021. My research focuses on political communication, attitudes and behaviour - specifically in and around electoral campaigns. I teach undergrad courses at Freie Universität Berlin, namely "Introduction in Political Communication" and "Election Campaign Research" and previously taught introductory courses on statistics at the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz.

Before starting my PhD, I was working as spokesperson for the [parliamentary group of the Green Party in Baden-Württemberg](https://www.gruene-landtag-bw.de/) and as a member of the campaign staff with the [Green party at Baden-Württemberg](https://www.gruene-bw.de/). I studied political science in a joint MA programme at [Universität Konstanz](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/), Germany and [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/), Spain. And gained a B.Sc. in Communication Science at [Universität Hohenheim](https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/).
