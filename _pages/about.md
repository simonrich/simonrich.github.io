I am a political scientist and PhD candidate in the [Otto-Suhr-Institut für Politikwissenschaft](https://www.polsoz.fu-berlin.de/polwiss/index.html) at [Freie Universität Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/). I defended my dissertation on the digital social contexts in modern election campaigns in February 2022. My research focuses on political communication, attitudes and behaviour - specifically in and around election campaigns. I teach undergrad courses at Freie Universität Berlin, namely "Introduction in Political Communication" and "Election Campaign Research" and previously taught introductory courses on statistics at the [Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz](https://www.uni-mainz.de/).

Before starting my PhD, I was working as a spokesperson for the [parliamentary group of the Green party in Baden-Württemberg](https://www.gruene-landtag-bw.de/) and as a member of the campaign staff at  the [Green party in Baden-Württemberg](https://www.gruene-bw.de/). I studied political science in a joint M.A. programme at [Universität Konstanz](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/), Germany and [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.cat/), Barcelona, Spain. Previously, I earned a B.Sc. in Communication Science at [Universität Hohenheim](https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/).
