I do research on citizens interaction with politics in (mostly) democratic political systems and its consequences. How people learn about politics, how they form their political attitudes and eventually act as part of a larger political system fascinates me. My research is focused on quantitative empirical methods, survey research and experimental research designs. Also I presented my research on several national and international scientific conferences, e.g. at the Annual Conferences of MPSA (2018, Chicago, USA), EPSA (2019, Vienna, Austria), ECPR (2019, Hamburg, Germany) and GOR (2018, Cologne, Germany).
